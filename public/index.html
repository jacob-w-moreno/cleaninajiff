    <meta property="og:description" content="Utah's Premier Car Detailing Service! I built this website for a friend of mine who recently started a Utah-based car detailing business. They already had a social media presence and were looking for ways to take their digital marketing game to the next level. So I, being a digital marketer turned web developer, offered my services and built this website for them. It is fully functional, but I'm still working to resolve a few issues and add a few more features. Hoping to finish it soon!"/>

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
